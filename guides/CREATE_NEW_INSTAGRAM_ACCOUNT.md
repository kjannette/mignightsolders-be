## Step 4: Get Instagram Business Account ID

### Method 1: Using Our Diagnostic Script

1. **First, generate a new access token** (to ensure it has the connection):
   
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kjannette/workspace/midnightsoldiers/midnightsoldiers-be
   ```

2. **Generate new token:**
   - Go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/
   - Select your app: **midnightsol**
   - Click **"Generate Access Token"**
   - Make sure these permissions are checked:
     * `pages_show_list`
     * `pages_read_engagement`
     * `pages_manage_posts`
     * `instagram_manage_insights`
     * `instagram_content_publish`
   - Click **"Generate Access Token"**
   - **Copy the token**

3. **Update generateLongLivedToken.js:**
   - Open `generateLongLivedToken.js`
   - Update `SHORT_LIVED_TOKEN` with your new token
   - Save the file

4. **Generate long-lived token:**
   ```bash
   node generateLongLivedToken.js
   ```
   - Copy the Page Access Token

5. **Update secrets.js temporarily:**
   - Open `secrets.js`
   - Update both `FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the new token
   - Save the file

6. **Run diagnostic to get Instagram ID:**
   ```bash
   node checkTokenPermissions.js
   ```
   - Look for: "Instagram Business Account found! ID: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
   - **Copy this ID** - you'll need it for Step 5

### Method 2: Using Graph API Explorer

1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/
2. Make sure your access token is selected
3. Make a GET request to:
   ```
   /me/accounts?fields=instagram_business_account
   ```
4. Find your page in the results
5. Copy the `instagram_business_account.id` value

## Step 5: Update Backend Configuration

1. **Open `secrets.js`:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kjannette/workspace/midnightsoldiers/midnightsoldiers-be
   ```

2. **Update these values:**
   ```javascript
   const INSTAGRAM_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID = "YOUR_NEW_IG_BUSINESS_ID"; // From Step 4
   const INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_NEW_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN"; // From Step 4
   const FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_NEW_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN"; // Same token
   ```

3. **Add a comment with today's date:**
   ```javascript
   // Long-lived token (60 days) with Instagram permissions - Generated: [TODAY'S DATE]
   // Connected to Instagram: @midnightsoldiers
   ```

4. **Save the file**

---

## Step 6: Test the Connection

1. **Verify token has all permissions:**
   ```bash
   node checkTokenPermissions.js
   ```
   
   You should see:
   ```
   SUCCESS! Your token has the critical Instagram permissions.
   Instagram Business Account found!
   ID: [your new ID]
   Matches secrets.js configuration
   ```

2. **Restart your backend server**

3. **Try posting a reel:**
   - Use your frontend to post a test reel
   - Check the console logs for success
   - Check Instagram to verify the post appears

## Step 7: Update Username Documentation (Optional)

Update any documentation or comments that reference `@ted_dancin_` to `@midnightsoldiers`

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Username 'midnightsoldiers' is not available"

Try these alternatives:
- `midnight_soldiers`
- `midnightsoldiers_official`
- `midnightsoldiers_art`
- `midnightsol` (to match your Facebook page name)

### "Can't switch to Business Account"

- Make sure you're using the mobile app (desktop doesn't support this)
- Make sure the account is at least 1 day old
- Make sure you've added a profile picture and bio
- Try logging out and back in

### "Can't connect to Facebook Page"

- Make sure you're an Admin of the Facebook Page
- Make sure the Instagram account isn't already connected to another page
- Try disconnecting any existing connections first
- Make sure you're logged into the correct Facebook account

### "Instagram Business Account not showing up"

- Wait 5-10 minutes after connecting (Facebook's systems need to sync)
- Generate a brand new access token
- Check that the connection is showing on both Instagram and Facebook

### "Still getting permission errors"

- Make sure you generated a NEW access token AFTER connecting Instagram
- Make sure the token has `instagram_content_publish` permission
- Make sure your Facebook App has Instagram API access enabled
- Check that your app is not in restricted mode
